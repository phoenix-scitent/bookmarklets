# bookmarklets

A repository for bookmarklets for Scitent quick solutions, such as autocompletes of LearnDash quizzes. 

**NOTE:** For proper MIME types, we should run everything through rawgit.com

Here are the steps to creating your own bookmarket:
1. Create a bookmark in your machine, can be to anything (say, http://example.com)
2. Change the content of the bookmark to be the content of the <something>.bookmarklet.js file, instead of the URL.
3. Try it!
